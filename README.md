# Pybank Python
 # Purpose
This python program takes a list of financial records included in [budget_data.csv](https://github.com/poojanagrecha/Pybank-Python/blob/main/PyBank/Raw%20Data/budget_data.csv) and determines some summary statistics. The file contains two columns: Date and Revenue. It returns a results file that includes the number of months included, the net revenue, the average change in revenue between months, the date and amount of the greatest increase in revenue, and the date and amount of the greatest decrease in revenue.

The task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
